        <b>All your best ideas. On the blockchain. Immutable forever. </b>
        That's the promise of Ideatribe.
        <br></br><br></br>
        
         We’ve noticed the best ideas come when
        you least expect them. We’re here to store them for posterity and help
        you change the world. Ideatribe was born out of a desire by the founding
        team to harness the creativity of the everyman ...You, us, everyone!
        <br></br><br></br>
        Ideatribe knows that the best ideas are truly democratic and
        decentralized. That’s why we make it easy to register your idea with us
        instantly and protect you from those who will want to claim it as theirs
        and profit from it. 
        <br></br><br></br>
        
        We also believe the best ideas come from Global
        collaboration. Not only will you be able to stake claim to your ideas,
        you’ll also be able to collaborate with others! 
        <br></br><br></br>

        Ideatribe are artists, musicians, writers, businesspeople, product
        specialists & brilliant engineering talent who have come together for
        one common purpose...to illuminate your ideas and help bring them to
        reality.
